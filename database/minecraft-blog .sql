Each modpack consists of a set of mods that add and modify many features within Minecraft, from adding new mobs, sounds, dimensions, and blocks, to introducing physics, weapons, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular types of modpacks among players is automation and technology. These modpacks often focus on city building, exploration, and making every aspect of their build as self-reliant as possible. The following modpacks introduce many steampunk elements to the game, from the Stone Age and prehistoric construction to running mega factories and making spaceships.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;The best Minecraft modpacks for the technologically aligned&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;5) Sky Factory 4&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sky Factory 4 is a modpack that takes a lot of inspiration from the ever-popular Skyblock game mode for&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;. Players start on a small island floating in the air with nothing but a tree and a few essential items at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The features these modpack offers are automation, magic, tech, and other resources. The default map might be Skyblock, but players have access to more than 30 other maps where they can build and automate anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This modpack has a progression method that relies on resource gathering, much like the vanilla version of Minecraft. It lets players choose the resources they want to produce rather than being forced to gather first and sort later. Other features include a Prestige system where players can unlock various mods and a time-traveling system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;4) Create: Above and Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Create: Above and Beyond is a modpack that focuses on making machines using redstone. The player&#39;s objective is to make it to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/5-best-space-mods-minecraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;, which is made possible by building spaceships in gigantic factories.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Players can get several designs to work on when making a spaceship and can choose to build the one they prefer. Each spaceship has a different layout and features, and its construction depends upon factors like resource availability.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Each factory&#39;s technological progression tree gets more complex as the game proceeds. The modpack consists of complex automation and other aspects like programming to activate and work on rockets and other machines.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;3) MC Eternal&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;MC Eternal is a large modpack that contains mods from every genre players can think of. While the primary focus of the pack is technology and automation, it also contains&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/minecraft-rpg-servers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, magical, and adventure elements.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A simple quest system guides players through the modpack&#39;s various adventures, along with a progression tree that allows players to unlock new technology and methods to run their factories more efficiently. Entire factories can be automated, and the world can be decimated using a nuclear bomb.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;2) SevTech: Ages&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sevtech: Ages is a modpack that aims to bring players from sticks and stones to the Age of technological marvels.

Players can find a few of them below:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Instead of attempting to create the profile on desktop, try creating it on a mobile device&#39;s web browser. The issue may be stemming from the PC client or desktop optimization on the page itself.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Try switching to the Windows 7/8 launcher as opposed to the Windows 10/11 launcher. The newer launcher occasionally runs into issues, including profile creation and not recognizing that the game (and not its demo version) is installed.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;If players do opt for the Windows 10/11 launcher, they&#39;ll want to download it from the main Minecraft website instead of the Microsoft Store. The version downloaded via Microsoft&#39;s store app has occasionally had authentication issues with players&#39; Microsoft accounts.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/how-restart-minecraft-launcher&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Log out of the launcher and Minecraft.net&lt;/a&gt;, re-login to the main site and attempt to make a profile. Sometimes, a disconnect between the launcher and the main site causes authentication issues.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Close the Xbox app installed by Microsoft Store, reopen it and attempt to run the launcher once again.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Disable any VPN or firewall currently active on your device. At times, a VPN can disorient the login and profile creation process, and firewalls can close out certain connections to sites and apps.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;According to Reader339 on Microsoft&#39;s support website, the problem may come from desktop web browsers running into a conflict with the site and a mechanic known as the Origin header. Fortunately, there are browser extensions such as &quot;Allow CORS&quot; and &quot;CORS Unblock&quot; that should eliminate any conflicts with the Origin header.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the possible fixes offered by the community. However, ideally, Mojang will view the bug reports and situate the problem on their end.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s perfectly fine for players to attempt to solve any profile creation issues, but the ultimate responsibility still falls on Mojang to ensure a concise and enjoyable gameplay experience on both Bedrock and Java Editions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', NULL, b'1'),

While the isle features a villager, there is next to no land outside what the village has generated directly, making the island relatively thin and narrow.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the village has spawned with a tree, meaning users will have access to renewable wood resources. There is also a blacksmith in the village to help aid progression.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;While this seed does not have quick access to any of the new 1.19 features, it does offer a fun and unique way to experience a survival world trapped amongst the villagers amid an ocean.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Village: -100, -450&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Small mushroom biome: 250, 250&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;9) Mangrove spawn&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The mangrove swamp spawn area (Image via Minecraft)&quot; src=&quot;https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/08b10-16546616426402-1920.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:1080px; width:1920px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The mangrove swamp spawn area (Image via Minecraft)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Seed code: 6306808076142139007&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The main draw of this seed is where gamers spawn: inside a mangrove swamp biome. This is one of the new biomes that 1.19 has added to the title, and it would typically need to be found through exploration of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This means that it would be totally RNG-dependent, and unlucky players might have a hard time finding one naturally.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seed will allow them quick and easy access to frogs. While the mangrove swamp that users spawn in is not particularly large, it is an excellent way to experience the biome initially before moving on to the other features that the game offers with the addition of 1.19.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;8) Pillager prisoner spawn&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The pillager outpost the player spawns at (Image via Minecraft)&quot; src=&quot;https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/b19b1-16546617040259-1920.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:1080px; width:1920px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The pillager outpost the player spawns at (Image via Minecraft)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The seed is: -7697517329571641383&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seed spawns gamers inside a plains biome, with a pillager outpost about 100 blocks away. While this is advantageous because it means that they will have quick access to the new allay, it also means that they will spawn near some mighty enemies, especially for underprepared players.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The proximity of the pillager outpost is the only downside to the seed. If not cautious, this can quickly cause user deaths, but having the outpost in the spawn chunks makes it very useful for a farm.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any automated farms located in the spawn chunks will work no matter where gamers are in the world, as the chunks are always loaded.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Allay cage location: 69, 87&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;7) Boggy outpost&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The pillager outpost on the edge of the mangrove swamp (Image via Minecraft)&quot; src=&quot;https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/461fb-16546618138808-1920.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:1080px; width:1920px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The pillager outpost on the edge of the mangrove swamp (Image via Minecraft)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seed is: -4890848222659350158&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seed is similar to the mangrove swamp spawn seed and the outpost spawn seed simultaneously. It features a pillager outpost inside a mangrove swamp.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The significant difference between this seed and those others is that while the latter spawns players next to the updated features, this seed has the updated features a little more than a thousand blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This will ensure they have easy access to allays, knowing the exact coordinates of the pillager outpost.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, it is also far enough away that users can confront the outpost whenever they would like and once they have had time to adequately prepare for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pillager outpost location: -1306, -343&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;6) Jungle crater&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The jungle crater gamers spawn in (Image via Minecraft)&quot; src=&quot;https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/3d522-16546618459748-1920.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:1080px; width:1920px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The jungle crater gamers spawn in (Image via Minecraft)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The seed is: 4923725547689910475&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seed spawns players inside a jungle biome cradled by a ring of stony peaks. A nether portal located near the center of this jungle biome will take them to a nether fortress hosting a double blaze spawner.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The jungle spawn is directly over an ancient city.

This is a double-edged sword, as it means they will have ample and easy access to wood and could potentially make a large treehouse base, claiming the canopy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;However, the real appeal of this base is, as the name implies, the stronghold located above a total of three different ancient cities. This means that players can set up a nether portal network that will connect them to the stronghold for easy access to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It will also allow them to loot ancient cities as they see fit without making long voyages after each potential death.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The stronghold also has a mineshaft attached to it, making the potential for loot even higher than just what the ancient cities have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The stronghold: 1640, 340&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ancient city one: 1225, 490&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ancient city two: 1386, 186&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ancient city three: 1621, 103&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;4) Bedrock Structures seed&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The mess of generated structures found on this seed (Image via Minecraft)&quot; src=&quot;https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/6d35d-16546639086826-1920.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:1080px; width:1920px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The mess of generated structures found on this seed (Image via Minecraft)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The seed is: 3546842701776989958&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since structure generation does not have parity between the Java and Bedrock editions of the game, this seed will only work for the latter&rsquo;s users in terms of structure generation. The terrain should primarily be identical between the two versions, however.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This seed spawns gamers near four structures of the game, with three being considered among the best it has to offer.

There is also a second deep dark biome nearby with additional access to the ancient city biome.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since there are so many&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/top-5-loot-items-players-can-get-ancient-city-minecraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in such a relatively small area, gamers should have easy access to whatever&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/top-5-chest-loot-items-find-minecraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;they might need to get from these cities.

Upon respawning, gamers can view the coordinates of the location they died in, along with the items they had before they met their end. Everything can be looted off the corpse, which remains in its spot and decomposes, turning into a skeleton eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;4) Easy Villagers&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;While the Easy Villagers mod might be a tad bit ridiculous, it is potentially one of the best quality-of-life extensions for&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;. It allows players to pick up villagers like they would any other item, carry them in their inventory, and place them in specific blocks according to their job.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, other mobs, like zombies, can be picked up and placed inside boxes as well. This is exceptionally helpful, as players will no longer have to chase villagers around to try and put them on a boat for transportation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;3) Advanced Compass&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This mod adds a new&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft-wiki/compass&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;bar in Minecraft that is a lot more informative than the base one. Aside from the direction, the bar also displays the player&rsquo;s coordinates as well as icons for every mob in the vicinity with regard to their direction.

Each of these can be dyed in various different colors and offers the option to send items directly to it or the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;1) Camp Chair&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;While Minecraft is filled with treacherous terrain and hostile mobs, it is also quite relaxing at times. Standing at a campfire and listing to the fire crackle under the night sky is one of the most serene things players can experience in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Camp Chair mod facilitates relaxation by adding a new block known as camp chair. Players can sit on this new inclusion. As its name suggests, the item can be set in front of campfires.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Players can craft camp chairs from logs as well as slabs and can even decorate them with wool.

This is perfect for beginners, as it&#39;s easy to replicate and build. You will need red/white wool and stone blocks to complete this lighthouse, but there are other ways you can make your own version using different materials if you want something more unique.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was created by YouTuber Munchucks and truly does a great job of explaining how to build a lighthouse that would look fantastic on any&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/top-5-minecraft-servers-building-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;4)&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Survival Lighthouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This lighthouse is a small and simple structure, perfect for building on your survival island. It&rsquo;s easy to build and has a nice aesthetic that makes it a good addition to your island.

It looks like a real lighthouse and has an actual working light that switches on when you turn your game on at night.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Working Lighthouse is also far more complicated than any other structure covered thus far. While building this blueprint will require some patience and persistence, it&#39;s worth it&mdash;and fortunately, this fantastic tutorial made by the Minecraft YouTuber Mr Mirror will help you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;2)&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Medieval Lighthouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is the perfect lighthouse to go with any medieval-themed build.

The medieval lighthouse is a tall building that sits on a rock out on the water and has a bridge leading up to it from below.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In order for this lighthouse to work properly and cast its light effectively, you will need to follow the tutorial as it&#39;s a hard task.

This is because it has a cottage house on the side, where the lighthouse keeper would normally live in real life. You can build this lighthouse in about an hour, making it perfect for those who just want a quick build before moving on to something more complex.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Cottagecore Lighthouse is also well suited for those who want to try out what Minecraft City Life is like as there are plenty of houses nearby that could be useful resources once you start building your own city.

If the toggle is grayed out, it means that your device is not RTX-enabled and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is important because RTX-enabled devices will easily get several shaders compared to those who do not have the feature.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;2) Search for the shaders&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;There are several websites with shaders for Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Image via Sportskeeda)&quot; src=&quot;https://staticc.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/11/8f1dd-16693926039763-1920.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:1080px; width:1920px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are several websites with shaders for Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Image via Sportskeeda)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Simply head to the browser and search for &#39;Minecraft Bedrock Edition shaders&#39;.

First, you must check for the word RTX as there will be shaders that only work with RTX and those that work without it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;If you have an RTX-enabled device, simply pick any one of the RTX shaders and download it from the website.
